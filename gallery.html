                    <div class="artwork-synopsis-description">
                        <p>"The Eternal Presence (Homage to Alejandro García Caturla)" is a painting by Wifredo Lam,
                            created in 1944. The work is an homage to the Cuban composer Alejandro García Caturla, who
                            was a friend of Lam's and a fellow member of the Grupo Orígenes, a literary and artistic
                            movement that sought to promote Cuban culture and identity.</p>
                        <p>The painting includes three human-animal hybrid creatures in a dense composition. The number
                            three not only represents the holy trinity in Christianity, but also, in Chinese philosophy,
                            symbolizes birth and new beginnings emerging from chaos. Lam explained that the
                            equine-female figure on the left (reminiscent of the horse-headed woman he painted in other
                            works) represents the paradise that foreigners seek in Cuba, a land of pleasures and
                            sickly-sweet music, and many scholars have interpreted her to be Oshun, the Orisha or deity
                            of love in Santería, while the other two figures appear to represent the warrior deities
                            Elegua and Ogun.</p>
                        <p>An additional layer of meaning comes from the significance of the horse in Chinese culture
                            (which Lam had begun to revisit and study upon his return to Cuba), in which the animal is
                            valued for its military usefulness. As well, horses in Chinese visual representation
                            frequently carry spiritual meaning, believed to guide individuals on heavenly journeys. The
                            work's layered meanings and myriad cultural references are reflected in the composition. The
                            limbs and bodies of the hidden figures twist and overlap with one another to a dizzying,
                            confusing effect, which is further enhanced by the monochromatic color palette that flattens
                            background and foreground. Emerging from this complex pictorial field, the figures' faces
                            meet the viewer's gaze directly, even confrontationally.</p>
                        <p>Lam intended the painting to serve as a commentary on the corruption of Cuba by imperialist
                            powers, and dedicated the work to one of his major artistic influences, Cuban composer and
                            judge Alejandro García Caturla, who was murdered on the morning of November 12, 1940, by the
                            defendant in a trial he was meant to oversee later that day. Only 34 years old at the time
                            of his death, Caturla was already a leader in Afro-Cubanism (an interdisciplinary movement
                            aimed at increasing the recognition of African culture in Cuban society), blending both
                            European and African musical elements in his compositions.</p>

                    <h2 class="artwork-synopsis-title"><em>Satan</em></h2>
                    <div class="artwork-synopsis-description">
                        <p>The painting, Satan, by Wifredo Lam features a central female figure in the foreground. This
                            figure is a combination of hybridized figures with distorted and elongated bodies. The
                            figures are arranged in a chaotic manner, with limbs and body parts interlocking and
                            overlapping.</p>
                        <p>One of the most striking aspects of the painting is the use of transmogrification, a device
                            frequently used by Lam in his work. In Satan, the figure's testicle "chin" is a clear
                            example of this technique. Lam was inspired by indigenous American and African ritual
                            objects, which often feature transmogrification of body parts to suggest magical
                            metamorphosis.</p>
                        <p>The central figure in Satan is also partly inspired by the femme-cheval or horse-headed woman
                            of the Santeria cult. This is reflected in the figure's elongated face and the suggestion of
                            a horse's head in her features.</p>
                        <p>The use of animal symbolism is another prominent feature of the painting. Lam's use of horse
                            imagery can be linked to his Afro-Cuban roots and his interest in the mythology and rituals
                            of Santería, a syncretic religion that developed in Cuba among enslaved Africans and their
                            descendants.</p>
                        <p>In Santeria, the horse is a powerful symbol that represents the Orisha (deities) Oya and
                            Ogun, among others. The Orishas are believed to be intermediaries between humans and the
                            supreme deity, and their possession is an important part of Santeria rituals. When a
                            practitioner is possessed by an Orisha, they are said to be "ridden" by the spirit, and the
                            experience is often described as being like a horse being ridden by a rider.</p>
                        <p>Lam, who was deeply influenced by African and Afro-Caribbean culture and mythology, often
                            incorporated horse imagery into his work as a way to explore themes of power,
                            transformation, and spirituality. In many of his paintings, horses are depicted with
                            elongated bodies, distorted features, and multiple heads, suggesting a merging of different
                            entities or a transformation into a powerful being. In works like Satan, Lam merges horses
                            with other forms or figures, creating hybrid creatures that blur the boundaries between
                            human and animal, and between the natural and the supernatural.</p>

                    <div class="artwork-synopsis-description">
                        <p>Wifredo Lam's painting "The Jungle" was created in 1943. It is an oil on canvas work that
                            showcases Lam's signature style that blends Cubism, Surrealism, and Afro-Cuban imagery.</p>
                        <p>The painting depicts a lush tropical jungle that is teeming with various elements, both
                            animate and inanimate. Several masked figures protrude out of the thick sugarcane field.
                            These figures appear to be part of the jungle itself, with vines and leaves growing out of
                            their bodies.
                            During the 1940s in Cuba, sugarcane was a major industry and a crucial part of the country's
                            economy. The production of sugarcane required a significant amount of labor, which was often
                            provided by Afro-Cuban and Haitian migrant workers. These workers were subjected to poor
                            working conditions, low wages, and discrimination, similar to the experience of Black
                            Americans in the cotton industry in the American South before the Civil War. This
                            exploitation of labor is a theme that is explored in this painting via the sugarcane
                            imagery.</p>
                        <p>The painting's title, "The Jungle," hints at the idea of a wild and untamed place, full of
                            life and danger. This theme is further emphasized by the various animals that are scattered
                            throughout the painting. There are snakes, lizards, birds, and insects, all of which add to
                            the sense of movement and activity in the jungle.</p>
                        <p>One element of the painting that stands out is the use of hidden figures. Upon closer
                            inspection, one can see that there are faces and other figures hidden within the leaves and
                            vines. This technique creates a sense of mystery and intrigue, as if the jungle is hiding
                            secrets that can only be uncovered by those who take the time to look closely.</p>
                        <p>Lam employs a wide range of hues, from deep greens and browns to bright yellows and oranges.
                            The colors are used to create a sense of depth and dimensionality, with the darker tones
                            receding into the background and the brighter tones popping out in the foreground.</p>
                        <p>In the essay "Strivings of the Negro People," W.E.B. Du Bois talks about the idea of double
                            consciousness, which refers to the way in which Black Americans must navigate two different
                            worlds – the world of Blackness and the world of whiteness. This concept is relevant to "The
                            Jungle" because Lam's use of hidden figures and Afro-Cuban imagery can be seen as a way of
                            highlighting the otherness of Blackness.</p>
