                    <p>Wifredo Lam's use of hidden figures in his artworks is a prominent feature that adds an intriguing layer of complexity to his already multifaceted pieces. The hidden figures he uses are often intertwined with various other elements in his works, such as surrealist imagery, Afro-Cuban spirituality, and mythological creatures.</p>
                    <p>The hidden figures in Lam's works can be seen as a representation of the marginalized or oppressed individuals within society, which is a recurring theme throughout his art. They are often positioned in the background or overshadowed by more prominent figures, which can be interpreted as a metaphor for the way society overlooks the struggles and injustices faced by these individuals.</p>
                    <p>Lam's contemporaries, such as Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) and Frida Kahlo (1907-1954), also utilized the technique of hidden figures in their works. Rather than Lam’s contemporaries, it would be more appropriate to consider Kahlo and Basquiat the two bookends to his career. Basquiat's works often depicted African American figures with symbolic elements that represented their struggle against oppression and marginalization. For instance, in his painting Irony of the Negro Policeman, Basquiat uses a skeletal figure of a black police officer, whose uniform and badge are partially obscured, to comment on the oppression of African Americans by the police. </p>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Similarly, in Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart), Basquiat depicts hidden figures to comment on the death of an African American graffiti artist who was killed by the New York City transit police.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Frida Kahlo's paintings also incorporate hidden figures and symbolism to express the marginalization and ‘otherness’ experienced by women and the disabled. In her painting The Two Fridas, Kahlo portrays two different versions of herself, one in traditional Mexican clothing and the other in Victorian-style clothing, to express her mixed heritage and sense of otherness.</p>

                        <img src="./images/two_fridas.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>In these works, Basquiat and Kahlo use hidden figures to explore the themes of otherness, marginalization, and double consciousness, which are also present in Lam's works. The use of hidden figures and symbolic elements in these artworks creates a sense of ambiguity and invites the viewer to interpret the work in their own way. Like Lam, Basquiat and Kahlo sought to challenge traditional representations of race and gender in art and to bring attention to the struggles of marginalized communities.</p>
                    <p>Lam and Picasso became good friends and had a significant influence on each other's art. They collaborated on several pieces, including the set and costume designs for the ballet "Jeux d'enfants" (Children's Games) in 1932.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Lam became a member of the Surrealist movement in Paris and was introduced to Breton by Picasso. Breton admired Lam's work and wrote an essay about him in his book "Le Surréalisme et la Peinture" (Surrealism and Painting). Breton and Lam also worked closely together on the publication of Breton's poetry collection, "Fata Morgana," for which Lam created a series of illustrations.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Despite their close relationship, Lam and Breton had some artistic disagreements, particularly regarding the role of politics in art. Breton was a staunch advocate of Marxism and believed that art should be used as a tool for political and social change. Lam, on the other hand, saw his art as a reflection of his personal experience and the spiritual and cultural traditions of his native Cuba.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Lam was introduced to Miró by his friend and fellow Surrealist, Benjamin Péret. The two artists had a mutual respect for each other's work and often discussed art and politics.</p>
                    <p>Lam and Alejo Carpentier met in Paris in the 1930s and became close friends. Carpentier was one of the leading figures in the Latin American literary movement known as "magical realism," which incorporated elements of fantasy and myth into realistic narratives. Lam's art was heavily influenced by this movement, and Carpentier's ideas about the relationship between art and identity.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Glissant and Lam shared a friendship and collaborated on a few projects. Édouard Glissant was a Martinican writer and theorist who wrote extensively about the legacy of colonialism and slavery, and his writings explored the complexities of Caribbean identity, culture, and history. Glissant's 1955 poetry collection, La Terre inquiète (The Troubled Land), features lithographs by Lam. The book was published by the Galerie du Dragon in Paris, where Lam exhibited his work. The lithographs in the book feature abstract forms that are in dialogue with the hybridized forms in Lam's paintings.</p>
